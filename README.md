## Robot Motor Control System
This project is an Arduino-based robotic car that uses four DC motors, a servo, and an ultrasonic sensor for autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance. The system first performs a pre-programmed movement sequence and then switches to a reactive mode.

## Features
- Pre-Programmed Movement: The robot drives forward, backward, and alternates turning for set durations.

- Autonomous Mode: It detects obstacles using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor.

- Reactive Behavior: When an object is detected within 10 cm, the motors stop, and the servo motor performs a sweeping action.
